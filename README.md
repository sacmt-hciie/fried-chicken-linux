Scale14x Joke
So what Distro are we going to start with. I wasn't going to fork it, somebody else said they were going to do that.
I could go for some Chicken Nuggets (should we alias that to a container format - i.e. snap)
For fun we could alias Recipie Names to a whole bunch of beginner/intermediate bash commands, if you learn the FC aliases and they achieve bash completion, you get the Open Souced Recipe, a badge on your desktop and another way to teach people about the commandline. 

I got the Idea from Pokemon, same idea, you type out 

Code: pikachu -al 
( ls aliased to pikachu ) you get a badge (anamation, graphics, interaction, education, sense of reward)

Gotta 'bash' Them All
It would have to be totally Rebranded, New-Graphics.
More Ideas Coming
